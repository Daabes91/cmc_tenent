# Telehealth Implementation Guide for Healthcare Practices

The rapid adoption of telehealth has transformed healthcare delivery, offering patients convenient access to care while helping practices expand their reach and improve efficiency. What began as an emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic has become a permanent fixture in modern healthcare, with 76% of patients now expecting telehealth options from their providers.

For healthcare practices, telehealth represents both an opportunity and a challenge. Done well, it can improve patient satisfaction, increase practice efficiency, and open new revenue streams. Done poorly, it can frustrate patients, burden staff, and create compliance headaches.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know to implement telehealth successfully in your practice.

## Understanding Telehealth

### Types of Telehealth Services

**Synchronous Telehealth (Real-Time):**
